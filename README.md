# Asl-object-recognition
object recognition: applying machine learning for object recognition and database retrieval

Task: It was proposed that we form study groups. That each group choose a paper or reading,  and each person in the group would spend a week reading it and finding related work. Then, the group would meet to discuss it and put together a presentation for the class. Find a module in openCV that illustrates the concepts.

Personal Project Goal: To be able to incorporate computer vision to determine an ASL sign(image) and interpret what it means.


Group Admin Members: Alyssa, Amy, David.
